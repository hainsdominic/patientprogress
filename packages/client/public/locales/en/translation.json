The open-source license provides free access to the source code of the web app and free access to the use, modification as well as the distribution of “PatientProgress”. </p><h4>Introduction</h4> <p> Your participation to this research project aimed to improve our understanding regarding a newly developed web app designed to collect clinical information for chiropractors would be greatly appreciated. Could you, however, take the time to read this letter attentively prior to giving us a formal agreement and signing this consent form. It will help you to understand the impact of an eventual participation to this study and help ensure that you provide an informed consent. </p><p> This form may use terms that you do not understand. We invite you to ask any question you deem necessary to the principal investigator or a member of its research team. Feel free to ask to clarify any information provided if required. Take all the time required to read and understand this form before taking a decision. </p><h4>Objectives and Project overview</h4> <p> The main objective of this research project is the implementation of a web app designed to collect clinical and patient management information using standardized electronic questionnaires within a national practice-based research network. </p><p> Patients must complete different questionnaires when they consult a chiropractor for the first time or when necessary to measure treatment response. The web app « PatientProgress » provides a opportunity for patients to complete these questionnaires online using a digital devise and a web browser and do so, prior to consulting the chiropractor. </p><p> The information collected is included in reports produced by the chiropractor using the web app. These reports become part of the patient’s health record and help define the diagnosis, plan of management, and health care required for patients. </p><p> Furthermore, this Web app aims to facilitate the implementation of scientific research studies. It will allow the development of an coded database using the information provided by the chiropractors and their patients who accept to participate to this study. These studies should help improve health care delivery. </p><h4>Your task</h4> <p> Your participation to this research project requires that you register within the web app “Patient progress” when you receive an email invitation and link to the web app sent by your chiropractor. Subsequently, you will have to complete different questionnaires using the web browser of your own computer, electronic tablet or smart phone. </p><p> These questionnaires can be completed any time prior to the planned initial consultation with your chiropractor. You will need approximately 30 minutes to complete these questionnaires. Two weeks after your first consultation with your chiropractor, you will be invited by email to complete a single questionnaire that will require 10 minutes to complete. Finally, you will be invited to complete a last set of questionnaires at the end of the treatment plan or prior to the 12th treatment visit depending on your defined treatment plan. You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire to help us assess the usability of the web app itself. The completion of this last set of questionnaires will require 20 minutes of your time. </p><p> The information collected using the web app will be part of your patient file. It includes identification information (i.e.: name, date of birth, gender, address, phone numbers, email address, etc.) and clinical information (i.e.: reason of consultation, health conditions, past personal and family history, physical activity, pain intensity and disability, etc.) We also collect information included in the reports prepared by your chiropractor using the web app including relevant examination findings, diagnosis, plan of management and evolution of treated health care conditions. </p><h4>Risks and inconveniences</h4> <p> No risk is associated to your participation to this research project. The time spent completing the various questionnaires (about 60 minutes) remains the only inconvenient. </p><h4>Benefits</h4> <p> The main benefit of expected from your participation to this research is contributing to the advancement of knowledge related to effective data collection among chiropractors and patients within a practice-based research network. </p><h4>Monetary compensation</h4> <p>No monetary compensation will be provided.</p><h4>Privacy policy</h4> <p> The information collected during this study is totally confidential. Only your chiropractor will have access to the information allowing your identification. The research team will not have access to your personal identification data, and you will only be identified using a numerical code to insure privacy. The results of this study may be reported within research articles, theses, or communications that will not identify participants. </p><p> The collected data are stored within an encrypted database and protected by a password. Only the research team will have access to these data for research purposes. The research team members have signed a confidentiality agreement. </p><p> The patient’s personal information collected using the web app « PatientProgress » becomes part of the patient’s health record. In accordance with chiropractic regulations, these data must be preserved within the patient health record a minimum of 5 years after the last consultation of the patient with the chiropractor. It will subsequently be possible to erase the patient record and data collected using the web app “PatientProgress”. </p><p> Coded data collected for this research project will also be preserved for a period of five years. The data will subsequently be erased and will not be used for other purposes unless you agree the further use of these data in the specific consent requested below. At any time, the participant can ask the principal investigator (François Hains) to erase the personal data collected for the current study. </p><h4> <b >Further use of the data for secondary analysis related to other research projects</b > </h4> <p> Do you accept that your research data be utilized to complete other research projects that have the general objective to improve chiropractic health care delivery. These projects will be evaluated and approved by the Research Ethic Committee of UQTR prior to their conduct. Your research data will be safely stored and only the researchers will have access. To safeguard your identity and privacy, you will only be identified by a numerical code. Your data will be kept if they remain useful for the advancement of scientific knowledge. Once it is no longer useful, it will be erased. However, you can ask for the destruction of your research data at any moment by contacting the research responsible for this research project. </p>",
