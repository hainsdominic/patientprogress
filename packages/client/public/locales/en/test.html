<h4>Conflict of interest declaration</h4>
<p>
  The principal investigator (François Hains) has developed the web App «
  PatientProgress » for clinical research. The open-source license provides free
  access to the source code of the web app and free access to the use,
  modification as well as the distribution of “PatientProgress”.

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
  Your participation to this research project aimed to improve our understanding
  regarding a newly developed web app designed to collect clinical information
  for chiropractors would be greatly appreciated. Could you, however, take the
  time to read this letter attentively prior to giving us a formal agreement and
  signing this consent form. It will help you to understand the impact of an
  eventual participation to this study and help ensure that you provide an
  informed consent.
</p>
<p>
  This form may use terms that you do not understand. We invite you to ask any
  question you deem necessary to the principal investigator or a member of its
  research team. Feel free to ask to clarify any information provided if
  required. Take all the time required to read and understand this form before
  taking a decision.
</p>
<h4>Objectives and Project overview</h4>
<p>
  The main objective of this research project is the implementation of a web app
  designed to collect clinical and patient management information using
  standardized electronic questionnaires within a national practice-based
  research network.
</p>
<p>
  Patients must complete different questionnaires when they consult a
  chiropractor for the first time or when necessary to measure treatment
  response. The web app « PatientProgress » provides a opportunity for patients
  to complete these questionnaires online using a digital devise and a web
  browser and do so, prior to consulting the chiropractor.
</p>
<p>
  The information collected is included in reports produced by the chiropractor
  using the web app. These reports become part of the patient’s health record
  and help define the diagnosis, plan of management, and health care required
  for patients.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, this Web app aims to facilitate the implementation of scientific
  research studies. It will allow the development of an coded database using the
  information provided by the chiropractors and their patients who accept to
  participate to this study. These studies should help improve health care
  delivery.
</p>
<h4>Your task</h4>
<p>
  Your participation to this research project requires that you register within
  the web app “Patient progress” when you receive an email invitation and link
  to the web app sent by your chiropractor. Subsequently, you will have to
  complete different questionnaires using the web browser of your own computer,
  electronic tablet or smart phone.
</p>
<p>
  These questionnaires can be completed any time prior to the planned initial
  consultation with your chiropractor. You will need approximately 30 minutes to
  complete these questionnaires. Two weeks after your first consultation with
  your chiropractor, you will be invited by email to complete a single
  questionnaire that will require 10 minutes to complete. Finally, you will be
  invited to complete a last set of questionnaires at the end of the treatment
  plan or prior to the 12th treatment visit depending on your defined treatment
  plan. You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire to help us assess the
  usability of the web app itself. The completion of this last set of
  questionnaires will require 20 minutes of your time.
</p>
<p>
  The information collected using the web app will be part of your patient file.
  It includes identification information (i.e.: name, date of birth, gender,
  address, phone numbers, email address, etc.) and clinical information (i.e.:
  reason of consultation, health conditions, past personal and family history,
  physical activity, pain intensity and disability, etc.) We also collect
  information included in the reports prepared by your chiropractor using the
  web app including relevant examination findings, diagnosis, plan of management
  and evolution of treated health care conditions.
</p>
<h4>Risks and inconveniences</h4>
<p>
  No risk is associated to your participation to this research project. The time
  spent completing the various questionnaires (about 60 minutes) remains the
  only inconvenient.
</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>
  The main benefit of expected from your participation to this research is
  contributing to the advancement of knowledge related to effective data
  collection among chiropractors and patients within a practice-based research
  network.
</p>
<h4>Monetary compensation</h4>
<p>No monetary compensation will be provided.</p>
<h4>Privacy policy</h4>
<p>
  The information collected during this study is totally confidential. Only your
  chiropractor will have access to the information allowing your identification.
  The research team will not have access to your personal identification data,
  and you will only be identified using a numerical code to insure privacy. The
  results of this study may be reported within research articles, theses, or
  communications that will not identify participants.
</p>
<p>
  The collected data are stored within an encrypted database and protected by a
  password. Only the research team will have access to these data for research
  purposes. The research team members have signed a confidentiality agreement.
</p>
<p>
  The patient’s personal information collected using the web app «
  PatientProgress » becomes part of the patient’s health record. In accordance
  with chiropractic regulations, these data must be preserved within the patient
  health record a minimum of 5 years after the last consultation of the patient
  with the chiropractor. It will subsequently be possible to erase the patient
  record and data collected using the web app “PatientProgress”.
</p>
<p>
  Coded data collected for this research project will also be preserved for a
  period of five years. The data will subsequently be erased and will not be
  used for other purposes unless you agree the further use of these data in the
  specific consent requested below. At any time, the participant can ask the
  principal investigator (François Hains) to erase the personal data collected
  for the current study.
</p>
<h4>
  <b
    >Further use of the data for secondary analysis related to other research
    projects</b
  >
</h4>
<p>
  Do you accept that your research data be utilized to complete other research
  projects that have the general objective to improve chiropractic health care
  delivery. These projects will be evaluated and approved by the Research Ethic
  Committee of UQTR prior to their conduct. Your research data will be safely
  stored and only the researchers will have access. To safeguard your identity
  and privacy, you will only be identified by a numerical code. Your data will
  be kept if they remain useful for the advancement of scientific knowledge.
  Once it is no longer useful, it will be erased. However, you can ask for the
  destruction of your research data at any moment by contacting the research
  responsible for this research project.
